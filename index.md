I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/) at Durham University. My recent research has been focused on numerical and theoretical Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, more prominently about the interaction of waves, vortices and turbulence in the atmosphere and ocean. Occasionally, I dabble into other areas of fluid dynamics (such as complex and biofluids) and develop new computational tools and methods. I also enjoy teaching different topics in maths, engineering and physics.
