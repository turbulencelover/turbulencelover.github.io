I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/) at Durham University. My recent research has been focused on numerical and theoretical Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, but my interests are fluid in addition to being about fluids.
