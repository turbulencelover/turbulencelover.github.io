## Computing Lagrangian Means Without Particle Tracking

This work is part of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team]( https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). 
A talk on eddy vertical structure that I presented virtually at the Ocean Sciences 2022 meeting may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BolUfp-Q8MQ&ab_channel=Zannalab-Climate%26OceanPhysics).

## Efficient Computation of Wave Transport and Scattering

## Scattering of Inertia-Gravity Waves by Geostrophic Turbulence

Ertel potential vorticity (EPV) is plotted; symmetrically unstable regions are those with negative EPV. SI develops along the sharp density fronts formed by the outflowing plume; as the plume evolves the SI leads to irreversible mixing and entrainment of the plume.*"%}

The top left panel is the alongshore velocity, marked by a bottom-intensified (blue) and surface-intensified (red) jet. The lower jet is formed as the dense water moves off the shelf and is deflected to the right by the Coriolis force; the upper jet is due to surface return flow that is also deflected to the right. The bottom-intensified jet is weaker due to the presence of bottom drag. The lower left plot shows the passive tracer concentration, used to track the dense shelf water as it descends down the slope through the bottom boundary and then undergoes off-slope mixing by symmetric instability. The right panels show the offshore and vertical velocities, where the signature along-front diagonal motions of the symmetric instability are evident.</i>

Shown is the sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice minimum (which typically occurs in September) and the sea ice maximum (March). The pink line shows the median ice edge from 1981-2010 for each of those months. Once can see the strong seasonal cycle in ice formation as well as the drastic decline in ice cover over the past several decades.*"%}

<i>Schematic (adapted from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001750">Jansen et al. 2019</a>) that illustrates the oceanic energy cycle and the role of unresolved mesoscale eddies therein. The interactions of the subgrid eddy kinetic energy must be parameterized in a model that does not fully resolve the mesoscales.</i>
