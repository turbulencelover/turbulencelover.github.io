Throughout my life, teaching has been one of my strong passions, and many aspects of it continue to fascinate me. Some of these aspects include the art of conveying a challenging concept to another human being, playing a role in the generation of knowledge, inspiring a passion for science, deepening my own understanding and simply enjoying a fulfilling social interaction. During 2020-2022, I worked as a University Teacher in the School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh, which coincided with COVID-19 pandemic. This challenging experience taught me how to adapt to unpredictable and fast-pace changes and to develop a new set of skills and knowledge that I could not have gained in normal circumstances. I am currently lecturing 1-2 course per year in my position as an assistant professor in applied mathematics. Please, find two teaching samples and the list of the courses I taught below.
