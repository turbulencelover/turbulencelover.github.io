Our global ocean (and climate) models are essentially numerical approximations of a set of fluid equations that describe the ocean dynamics across the entire planet. However, these numerical approximations fall short in capturing very fast phenomena such as waves or very small-scale ones like microphysics. We need good mathematical models to incorporate the effects of these unresolved phenomena into the ocean and climate models.

In this project, we study some mathematical models of oceanic phenomena that are not fully resolved in the global climate models and try to use numerical simulations to verify these models or understand them better. Depending on the students interest and skillset, this project can have a more programming or mathematical side. The mathematical tool that we use for modeling is the purtubation methods. For the numercal simulations, we learn to use a recently developed ocean model called <b>Oceananigans</b> [1]. This a numerical model that in addition to having a cool name is very user-friendly and well documented. You also learn about certain aspects of ocean physics like the interaction of waves and voritices.

This project is well suited for students with programming skills and a passion for climate and geophysical fluids. Some knowledge of fluid mechanics is necessary for this project (it is ideal if you have taken Fluid Mechanics III). It is also very useful if Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluids IV is taken alongside this project.
